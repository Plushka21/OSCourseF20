Difference between physical and virtual adress.

Virtual address is generated by CPU during program execution. It does not physically exist. Virtual adress is used to access physical memory (using MMU).

Physical address refers to the real location of data in memory. User cannot get direct access to it, he/she needs to use virtual address for this purpose.
