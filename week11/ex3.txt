In first example of code output is the following:

Hello
Hello // 2 lines with Hello

While in second example it is the following:

Hello

      // Hello and 2 empty lines

The output differs because of \n in printf() function.

In first case the buffer is not freed after printf() and thus fork() copies everything and Hello is printed again.

In second case printf() is called, cursors moved to the nex line, buffer is freed and fork() is called that prints another empty line.
